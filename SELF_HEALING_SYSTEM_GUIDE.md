# 🤖 Self-Healing Temperature Monitoring System

## 🎯 Overview

Your system now has **AI-powered self-healing capabilities**! The system continuously monitors all Python files for errors and automatically fixes them without shutting down. It keeps all your existing servers running while providing intelligent error detection and correction.

## ✨ What's New

### 🔄 **Self-Healing Features**
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Scans all Python files every 30 seconds
- **Automatic Error Detection**: Finds syntax and runtime errors
- **AI-Powered Fixes**: Uses Gemini AI to generate corrections
- **User Approval**: Always asks for permission before applying fixes
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates backups before any modifications
- **System Never Stops**: Fixes errors without shutting down servers

### 🏗️ **System Architecture**
- **One Main File**: `self_healing_system.py` runs everything
- **All Servers Included**: Simulation, UI, and AI Chat servers
- **Background Monitoring**: AI monitor runs in background thread
- **Integrated Fixing**: No separate fixer needed

## 🚀 How to Run

### **Simple Start (Recommended)**
```bash
python self_healing_system.py
```

That's it! This single command will:
1. ✅ Check your environment configuration
2. ✅ Verify all dependencies
3. ✅ Start all three servers (Simulation, UI, AI Chat)
4. ✅ Begin continuous AI monitoring
5. ✅ Auto-fix any errors that occur

## 🔧 How Self-Healing Works

### **1. Continuous Monitoring**
- Scans all Python files every 30 seconds
- Checks for syntax errors
- Tests runtime errors on main server files
- Logs all detected issues

### **2. Error Detection**
When an error is found:
```
🚨 Syntax error detected in simulation/sensor_server.py
🔧 AI wants to fix: simulation/sensor_server.py
📋 Error: SyntaxError in sensor_server.py:45: invalid syntax
💡 Proposed fix preview: def get_temperature():
    return random.uniform(20.0, 40.0)

❓ Apply this fix? (y/n/d for details): y
💾 Created backup: .self_healing_backups\sensor_server.py.backup_20250901_230145
📝 Applied AI-corrected code to simulation/sensor_server.py
🔍 Verifying fix...
✅ Fix applied successfully!
```

### **3. User Control**
- **Always asks permission** before making changes
- **Shows error details** and proposed fix
- **Option to see full fix** with 'd' command
- **Can decline** any fix with 'n'

### **4. Safety Features**
- **Automatic backups** before any changes
- **Fix verification** after applying changes
- **Error logging** for all detected issues
- **System status tracking**

## 🎛️ **System Status**

When you stop the system (Ctrl+C), you'll see a summary:
```
⏹️  Shutting down self-healing temperature monitoring system...

📊 System Status Summary:
   - Total errors detected: 3
   - Total fixes applied: 2
   - AI client was available: true

👋 Goodbye!
```

## 🔐 **Environment Setup**

Make sure you have your Gemini API key set:

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable (Windows PowerShell)
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Option 2: .env file in project root
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
```

## 📁 **Backup System**

All fixes are backed up automatically in `.self_healing_backups/`:
```
.self_healing_backups/
├── sensor_server.py.backup_20250901_230145
├── ui_server.py.backup_20250901_230201
└── ai_chat_server.py.backup_20250901_230234
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

### **🔄 Never Stops Running**
- System continues running even when errors occur
- AI fixes issues in real-time
- No manual intervention needed for common errors

### **🛡️ Always Safe**
- User approval required for all changes
- Automatic backups before modifications
- Fix verification after application

### **🤖 Intelligent**
- AI understands context and fixes appropriately
- Learns from your codebase patterns
- Handles both syntax and runtime errors

### **📊 Transparent**
- Shows exactly what errors were found
- Displays proposed fixes before applying
- Tracks all system activity

## 🚨 **Error Types Handled**

### **Syntax Errors**
- Missing colons, brackets, quotes
- Indentation issues
- Invalid Python syntax

### **Runtime Errors**
- NameError (undefined variables)
- ImportError (missing modules)
- AttributeError (wrong method calls)
- Logic errors in main server files

### **Edge Cases**
- Network connectivity issues
- API key problems
- Configuration errors
- File permission issues

## 🎉 **Success!**

Your system is now **self-healing**! It will:

1. ✅ **Run continuously** without manual intervention
2. ✅ **Detect errors** automatically in real-time
3. ✅ **Ask for permission** before making any changes
4. ✅ **Fix issues** using AI intelligence
5. ✅ **Keep all servers running** (Simulation, UI, AI Chat)
6. ✅ **Create backups** for safety
7. ✅ **Provide status updates** and summaries

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **If AI client fails to initialize:**
- Check your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Install the Gemini SDK: `pip install google-generativeai`
- The system will still run, but without auto-fixing

### **If you want to disable monitoring:**
- Press Ctrl+C to stop the system
- The monitoring runs in background and can't be disabled while running

### **If a fix fails:**
- Check the backup files in `.self_healing_backups/`
- Restore from backup if needed
- The system will continue monitoring for other issues
